glocate


I find that the output of the locate and find commands can be 
rather confusing if a lot of files match

glocate takes a list of files and displays it as a gtk tree

example usage:

$glocate -r '\.mp3'

    Works like a graphical locate, by calling the system locate command.

$locate -r '\.mp3' | glocate

    Identical, but calling the locate command explicitly

$find . -name "*.mp3" | glocate

    Similar display, but using the find command instead of locate

$find . -name "*.mp3" > music
$find . -name "*.wav" >> music
$grep "britney" music | glocate -

    Saving intermediate output to a file and then displaying that
