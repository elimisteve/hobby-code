<p>I'm looking for contract programming work
in Cambridge. I like challenges.<br>
</p>
<p>I'm good at understanding and solving difficult problems.
Having solved them I'm good at explaining the answers.</p>
<p>I'm talkative, literate, lucid and friendly. I'm a good communicator
and I write programs that are intended to be read by others. </p>
<p>I have a degree in mathematics from King's College. I'm
also interested in Computer Science. </p>
<p>I run my own limited company (J.L. Aspden Ltd) and can be hired
through it. In my spare time I program for fun.<br>
</p>
My favourite computer books are: <a

      <p>I completed a set of Java bindings to the Xen API,
automatically generating them from the XenServer OCaml code. I wrote an
extensive series of automatic tests for the bindings, as well as
examples of how to use them. I wrote corresponding examples for Python,
and a tutorial introduction to XAPI. I wrote a pool monitoring plugin
for nagios. I wrote host monitoring and VM restarting daemons, with a
curses based configuration UI, and packaged them as rpms and debs.<br>

      <p>I wrote software to calculate statistics on the output of a
brain
scanner. The initial prototyping and tests were in python for speed of
development, and then I translated the main program into a C library
for ease of incorporation into their existing software, whilst using
SWIG to keep the original unit test framework.</p>

      <p> I solved some mysterious bugs in a project to split DSP code
across several code pages, and then automated the build process and

browser-based

use Windows Comms and work
with Chinese, Korean and Japanese scripts. </p>

cancelled, saving the company a fortune at my expense!</p>
