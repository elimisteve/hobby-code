			<P>I wrote software to calculate statistics on the output of a
			brain scanner. The initial prototyping and tests were in python
			for speed of development, and then I translated the main program
			into a C library for ease of incorporation into their existing
			software, whilst using SWIG to keep the original unit test
			framework.</P>

			<P>Having been engaged to implement it, I evaluated the time,

			for a portable radio. Disliking the proposed new interface, I
			wrote a simulator, found the right people to show it to, and got
			the project cancelled, saving the company a fortune at my expense!
