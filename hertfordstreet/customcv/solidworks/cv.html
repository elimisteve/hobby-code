<p> I'm looking for contract programming work in Cambridge. 
I like challenges.</p>
<p>I'm talkative, literate, lucid and friendly. 
I'm a good communicator and I write programs that are 
intended to be read by others. </p>
<p>I have a degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge. I'm
also interested in Computer Science.</p>
<p>I'm good at understanding and solving problems.
Having solved them I'm good at explaining the answers. </p>
<p> I run my own limited company (J.L. Aspden Ltd) and can be hired
through it. If you need a team I can bring friends.</p>
<p>My favourite computer books are: 
The C Programming Language, 
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 
Structured Analysis and Design, 
The C++ Programming Language, 
The Mythical Man-month, 
Peopleware, 
The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design, 
Dive into Python
and the 1979 TRS80 Basic manual.

      <td> <b>Python, C, SWIG, Signal Processing (wavelets, Hurst
exponent), MATLAB, Octave</b>
      <p>I wrote software to calculate statistics on the output of a
brain
scanner. The initial prototyping and tests were in python for speed of
development, and then I translated the main program into a C library
for ease of incorporation into their existing software, whilst using
SWIG to keep the original unit test framework.</p>

      <p> I solved some mysterious bugs in a project to split DSP code
across several code pages, and then automated the build process and
dependency generation. I debugged, modified and version controlled a
browser-based
error tracking/change control system. I converted an ancient program to
use Windows Comms and work
with Chinese, Korean and Japanese scripts. </p>

portable radio. Disliking the proposed new interface, I wrote a
simulator, found the right people to show it to, and got the project
cancelled, saving the company a fortune at my expense!<br>
I evaluated the ClearCase version control system, wrote
recommendations for its use and gave some training.</p>
