Last year, we lost almost every game. For some of them we couldn't scrape up 11 players.

The consensus opinion was that the only way we could beat the Champion of the Thames was by getting
a different team.

Furthermore, I promised when I took the captaincy that I wouldn't select people on their ability, 
although I did say that I'd take note of how much work people put into practising over the Winter.

And I also promised that I wouldn't pick people who weren't regular drinkers in the Radegund over those who were.


This year, we played 17 matches. 

On all but two occasions I had enough people to make an XI committed to playing weeks before. 
When we didn't, it took me five minutes on the phone to find our 11th man.

Two of our games were rained off, two were Veras matches, and for two our
opposition couldn't raise a team.

When we played the Devonshire Arms, they were so short of people that I sat down with Beard
beforehand and we divided the players up in order to engineer the most even match possible.


Out of the remaining 10 games:

We lost three, we drew one, and won six.


I'll just mention two high points.

We played the Red Guards for the first time this year, and they were by common agreement the best Cambridge team any of us has ever played against.
And we scored 229.
And by the end of the game they were dead-batting. Grimly hanging on for a draw at 204 with no wickets left.
It was the best cricket match I have ever played in.

We beat the Champion of the Thames, the team everyone thought would be unbeatable, by seven wickets.
We bowled them out for fifty.

And what's much more important, it was a team of friends. 
Mostly the people who'd been practising and drinking together for the previous year.

What made the difference? Coaching, Practice and Team Spirit.

We organised regular nets, and people came, 

Bones came to coach almost every one, and gave great advice to everyone. Whether it was teaching some of us to bat from scratch, or making small adjustments to our best players, I don't think there's any one of us who wasn't much improved by listening to what he said and practising it.

Once we had a hard core of people coming regularly, nets became a thing that people didn't want to miss.

I was getting people ringing me up to say sorry they couldn't make it.

And the attitude carried on into the Summer. Mostly, everyone wanted to play in every game.

By the time of the match against the Champion of the Thames, we'd only lost one real game and we'd won six.

I think we'd have beaten the Champ anyway, but Steve Haslemere's immortal 5 wickets reduced them to rubble.

And after that anticlimax I was wondering if we'd overdone it a bit.

It was a huge amount of fun getting better together over the Winter, but if we'd been playing in a
league we'd have been about to be promoted out of it.

I was starting to wonder if there'd be any reason to try next year, or whether we'd just coast aimlessly to victory whilst our wonderful team disintegrated under the lack of pressure. 

Even our single defeat in the first game of the season looked like a distant, bad, inexplicable memory. Teething troubles.

Luckily at that point, the wheels fell off.

The Free Press and Jack Frost XI showed us in consecutive weeks that given the opportunity, our batting can collapse without resistance. The last game of the season had *us* grimly hanging on for a draw in a timed game. We didn't make it.

So, here we are, beaten and hungry. With something left to prove.

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. 
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

And on that note I give you, ladies and gentlemen, Tom Lewis, our captain for 2011.
