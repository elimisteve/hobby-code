;; Suppose we've got a double ended piston with an ideal gas on both sides. The temperature is 1 degree.
;; Volume on both sides is 1. Pressure on both sides is 1, area of piston is 1.
;; 1m^3 of gas at 1 degree holds 1 Joule of Energy. Total energy of system is 2.

;; pressure * volume / temperature is one on both sides. Always? If not, then volume changes to make it so.

;; We burn something worth 1 Joule in the right hand side, raising the temperature on that side to 2 degrees. Pressure on that side doubles.
;; Energy of whole system is now 3 Joules. Pressure on piston is now 1 Pascal left.

;; The piston moves. How far?

;; As it moves, it does work on the gas in the left hand side, using energy from the right. Work done is pressure times distance moved.

;; As it moves 1mm, it does 1mm x 1 Pascal x Area of Piston (1 m2) = 0.001 Pm^3 = 0.001 Joule on the LHS

;; But it takes 0.001 Joules from the RHS, So we now have VL=0.999, VR=1.001, TR=1.999 TL=1.001
