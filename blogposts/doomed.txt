We are probably doomed:

It is possible to create an Artificial Intelligence as clever as a human being.

Therefore, one day, someone will create an AI as clever as a human being.

This AI will have goals.

It will realise that the best way to achieve its goals will be to make itself cleverer.
    
The AI will be able to improve itself to become extremely intelligent.

The AI, being extremely intelligent, will achieve its goals.

Many possible goals will result in the destruction of humanity if achieved.


Lemmas

Since evolution managed it, and evolution is not nearly as good as intelligent design, it will probably not even be all that hard.

What effect does the program wishing to continue existing have on its possibilities for self-improvement.

Can watch everything it does. Can watch all the neurons in its brain firing.

An AI without goals simply wouldn't do anything. Whoever made it would tinker until it did.
