Stemming the Red Tide
A rendezvous at the Old Summer Palace


King's College, the most beautiful building in all England, was in the 1980s a somewhat confused mixture of political beliefs.
Young ladies of King's College Boat Club decided to offer themselves up for public auction in order to raise money for a new boat.
Student's union banned a boat club slave auction because it was disrespectful to slaves.
Socialist workers called Galadriel vs boat club hoorays called Mike throwing each other in the fountain, both crying 'Liberation for Women'

lefty in the sense that the Worker's Revolutionary Party was thought to be 
Unwisely accepted an invitation to play the Red Guards at Kings, under the impression that they were a King's old boys side.
	
King's scene of greatest game in Rad history
baking sunshine, beautiful aspect
Parents coming down to watch. Team did me proud, photograph of me standing in shock and awe next to unheard of score of 229.
Best team we've ever played forced into batting out a draw.
Amusing episode of Hanglin, who had taken five of our wickets, running out his own brother, who had taken another three, rather spoiled when he went on to make 39 runs off about two overs.


Remarked on at the time was the fact that that single game had wrecked the bowling figures of everyone who bowled in it for the entire season.
Steve Haslemere had until this game been one of three bowlers performing roughly equally in terms of figures. By having not played while everyone else was being biffed around he acquired a commanding lead 

None of us pay, or have ever paid, any attention to such statistical silliness. It is a relic of unenlightened times, inappropriate for modern forms of the game. 

It was noticed the following year that various Summer holidays were booked only after the announcement of the fixture list.

Old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas

gunmetal sky, chilling wind

Campaigned tirelessly against our bourgeois tendencies
Reigned in our intellectual elitism with high predjudice.

	
Lewis, the child of a former landlord, fatally lost the toss.
	
Rad field shocking
J Menzies 130, previous highest score that season had been 2

Hanglin G, ran his brother out in previous game, and made up for it with five wickets and a fast forty. Brother had to settle for just the three.


scored vast numbers of runs very quickly


Lewis tries the desperate tactic of bringing me on to bowl, hoping to baffle the half- and the sesqui- centurion with extreme lack of pace. One over and 15 runs later the experiment was brutally terminated to the relief of everyone on the field.

Ben Till, first game for StRadegund, capitalist hopping-dog
did as much damage to his own wicket as he had to that of Menzies in the first innings.

Cockcroft, John, Oxford Blue leg spinner.


Four Olds. We had three old boys of Bradford Grammar.in Lewis, Barry, John Cockcroft, Jim Downing.

Fifty days of White Terror
Chinese roulette
Great Leap Forward

Radical and conservative factions

Excited youths took inspiration from Lewis's vague pronouncements, generally believing the sanctity of his words and making serious efforts to understand what they meant.

Factions quickly formed based on individual interpretations of his statements.


Hanglin G huge hitter, scored 46 very quickly.

No Nick, Beard, Ollie (thesping), or Joe

ringer John Cockcroft, old friend of Tom's, Oxford Blue and leg-spinner.

Jessop, turned up late, having got absorbed watching some cars going down the capitalist roads of Monaco. (Monaco Grand Prix)

Captain, Wicket Keeper, Opening Batsman, announced, with a tear in his eye, that the game was over.

Red Guards have a habit of bringing pairs of good brothers. Ben Till glorious catch of G. Menzies
