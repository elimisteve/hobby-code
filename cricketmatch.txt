A Rendezvous at the Old Summer Palace

               Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer

King's College, the most beautiful building in all England, was host in the 1980s to a somewhat confused mixture of political beliefs.

I recall a night when the sportier young ladies of the college offered themselves up for public auction in order to raise money for a new boat. The student union, fresh from the triumph of banning overtly heterosexual behaviour on college grounds, instantly mandated the cancellation of the event on the grounds that such an auction would cause further unwarranted distress to the world's remaining slaves.

One of my favourite memories of studenthood is a happy evening of blazered boat club thugs called Kevin and vicious socialist workers called Galadriel throwing each other into an ornamental pond under the serene gaze of the beloved founder, all simultaneously howling liberation with equal outrage and conviction.

So when, last year, an organization calling itself the Red Guards challenged the blessed Saint Radegund to a game at King's ground, we accepted assuming them to be a team of alumni either keeping the faith, or recalling it.

Given that the only decent cricket team King's ever put out was formed almost exclusively of Australian post-graduates, who are now running Australia and so unlikely to be free, I thought we'd be well enough matched.

But no.

The Red Guards turned out to be composed almost exclusively of first-team cricketers from various fabled local sides, the few exceptions sporting University or County colours. Their kit alone was enough to inspire weakness and trembling in the faithful. And that was before I'd remembered what a bouncy track King's is on a baking summer day.

And yet, and yet... We fought them to a draw. Heroic performances from an unrecognisable Radegund XI left the Red Guards hanging desperately on to their last wicket, grimly dead-batting through four tense overs.

That was by common agreement the best game any of us had ever played in. (footnote: Apart from Beard, who'd once been involved in an even more thrilling match in the Afghan highlands, with the fate of a province and a princess hanging on the result. A close-run thing by all accounts, and the history of Asia might have been very different had the local rules not valued the striking of a goat's head at an unprecedented 7 runs.)

Only we knew how much above ourselves we'd played that glorious day. It was thought that the rematch might be a different matter, if we met our more usual standard against a good team out for revenge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had been remarked at the time that that one single game had wrecked the bowling figures of everyone involved for the entire season. One S. Haslemere had until then been one of three bowlers performing roughly equally in terms of figures. By not playing while everyone else was getting biffed around he first acquired the commanding statistical lead which he was to hold on to and extend for the rest of the Summer.

None of us pay, or have ever paid, the slightest attention to such foolishness. It is a relic of unenlightened times, inappropriate for modern forms of the game. But a number of summer excursions happened to coincide with this year's match.

No Nick, no Beard, no Ollie, no Joe, all heroes of the last encounter. Even the brave sacrifice of young Dave Jessop, who consented literally to risk his life by making this most eagerly awaited hard contested game his fourth ever experience of sport, could not produce eleven to face the coming storm. We called in desperation on our allies. One came.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And there was gunmetal sky and a chilling wind. Old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas.

A band of brothers out for revenge. Weak and ineffectual resistance from the old order. The Guards, campaigning tirelessly against our bourgeois tendencies, reigned in our intellectual elitism with high prejudice.

Lewis, the child of a former landlord, fatally lost the toss.

The Guards elected to bat, and their opening batsmen began their long march.

Finally Swarbrick fell to Evans. Blood on 43. But Menzies ground on implacably toward his titanic total. He was joined by his brother and the runs piled on.

There was hope, then, when Cockcroft and Till conspired to take the wicket of the lesser Menzies with a glorious catch, and immediately Jack hooked Pike, trapped before, fishing, for a duck.

But we had succeeded only in bringing Hanglin to the wicket. He dispensed with the old custom of the single, and was a mortar of the revolution, belting the ball to the boundary in great leaps, forward and square, over and over and over again.

And the Son of Heaven, in his desperation, brought your correspondent on to bowl, hoping to baffle the played-in, in-form, half- and sesqui-centurions with extreme lack of pace. One over and 15 runs later the experiment in Chinese Roulette was brutally terminated to the relief of everyone within range of the guns.

When mighty Hanglin finally missed a straight one, from Burberry, it only brought *his* brother to the crease, and our re-education continued for more agonizing overs until the Guards declared their innings closed on a frightening 247 for 4.

Menzies, undismissable hero of the people, whose previous highest score that summer had been 2, had carried his bat, and contributed 130 of these runs.

Fifty overs of White Terror. But we were not dismayed. We had our Four Olds. We had our radical, and our conservative factions.

We had our ringer, John Cockcroft, old friend of Tom's and Oxford Blue.

Excited youths took inspiration from Lewis's vague pronouncements, generally believing the sanctity of his words and making serious efforts to understand what they meant.

Factions quickly formed based on individual interpretations of his statements.

For a time it looked as though the day might go to the forces of reaction.

Lewis, and Grieveson, went to 95 without loss against the fury. But the ill-starred straight ball struck again.

Ben Till, capitalist hopping-dog, in his first game for the virgin, did as much damage to his own wicket as he had to that of Menzies.

But our glorious leader carried on to the divine fifty that has been his divine right this year, and Cockcroft played well, dug in, until he became, on 34, Hanglin's second wicket.

And we had 154-4, and time to get the rest.

But Jack was lbw for 7, and I covered myself in a glorious 1 to give the Hanglin who had not dominated with the bat his fourth wicket, and on 164-6 Burberry and Evans, looking into the face of chaos, sagely dropped their anchors in the middle and stopped the rot.

And there was time, there was time, for it all to go wrong, but like wise and wily peasants they shut up their shops and they hid their corn.

And when Evans finally went, he went for one, but what an endless, glorious, destiny-filled one it had been, with the spirits of his ancestors breathless upon it, and in the last few overs, Downing and peerless Burberry opened up and took the Capitalist Road, and showed us what we might have been.

And then our inspiration, our captain, our opening batsman, our wicket keeper, our god gathered us in his library, and slowly, and with a tear in his eye, and patiently he explained to us that the game was ended, finished, over and gone.
