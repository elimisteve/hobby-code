Original version after:
http://stuartsierra.com/2009/09/03/mavens-not-so-bad

Next modified in accordance with:
http://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin

at this point we can get 

mvn install
mvn clojure:repl

to work, although it's not clear to me what they've achieved

now added 

mvn clojure:run
mvn clojure:test

which both run the hello.clj script

Now we've used these two commands to add swank to the local maven repository:

$ wget http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jochu/swank-clojure/swank-clojure-1.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.zip

$ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.codestuffs.clojure -DartifactId=swank-clojure -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=swank-clojure-1.0-SNAPSHOT/swank-clojure-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

and added yet more boilerplate to pom.xml

Unbelievably, that appears to have worked, allowing something to start on port 4005

Much to my amazement, this responds to slime-connect on 127.0.0.1 port 4005

In summary, the following commands now work, although the repl and swank targets, while
creating usable repls and servers, don't seem to have taken any notice of the program file
hello.clj.

$ mvn clojure:compile
$ mvn clojure:test
$ mvn clojure:run
$ mvn clojure:repl
$ mvn clojure:swank
