Original version after:
http://stuartsierra.com/2009/09/03/mavens-not-so-bad

Next modified in accordance with:
http://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin

at this point we can get 

mvn install
mvn clojure:repl

to work, although it's not clear to me what they've achieved

now added 

mvn clojure:run
mvn clojure:test

which both run the hello.clj script
