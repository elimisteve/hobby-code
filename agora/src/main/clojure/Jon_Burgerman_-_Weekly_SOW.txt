Style Loose Distinctive Influence Proces s Media Technique Enlarge Develop 3D Develop Model Adapt Refine Experiment

What Pupils Produce
• Pupils create a variety of small scale works on a range of surfaces. They stick these into their sk etchbook and evaluate their successes and failures. They explore a variety of techniques. Pupils choose one of their doodles (or a Burgerman one) to develop into a small scale 3D model. They take photos of the process to create a page in their book that documents their experiment. Pupils ask Jon to make notes in their sketchbooks and tak e photos of him at work. They produce a page in their book documenting the day and detailing their experience. •

Workshops offering use of a variety of techniques adaptation of own ideas in response to these s essions. Evaluate strengths and limitations, set realistic goals with success criteria. Monitor own performance and progress, inviting feedback from others and making changes to further learning. Evidence: • Regular use of self and peer evaluations - sheets attached to relevant piece of work. • • • Writing of own success criteria during lessons.
