Version 0.0 "Hello World"

Compojure and clojure-contrib need to be separately built and installed 
into maven repository.

Compojure's dependencies are listed in pom.xml 
so that they can be handled by maven itself.

at this point we can get 

mvn clojure:repl
mvn clojure:swank

to run.

At the repl

(use 'hello)
(hello)

will start the server
and we can look at http://localhost:8080

Now we've used these commands to add swank to the local maven repository:

$ wget http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jochu/swank-clojure/swank-clojure-1.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.zip

$ unzip swank-clojure-1.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.zip

$ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.codestuffs.clojure -DartifactId=swank-clojure -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=swank-clojure-1.0-SNAPSHOT/swank-clojure-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

and added yet more boilerplate to pom.xml

Unbelievably, that appears to have worked, allowing something to start on port 4005

Much to my amazement, this responds to slime-connect on 127.0.0.1 port 4005

In summary, the following commands now work, although the repl and swank targets, while
creating usable repls and servers, don't seem to have taken any notice of the program file
hello.clj.

$ mvn clojure:compile
$ mvn clojure:test
$ mvn clojure:run
$ mvn clojure:repl
$ mvn clojure:swank
