Chapter 1, You can't win an argument

The best way to win an argument is to avoid it:
  Carnegie himself arguing about Bible/Shakespeare at a banquet
  Salesman who reacts to prospect's praise of other trucks by saying how good they are
  Josephine's butler who managed to lose to her at billiards
  Lincoln's reprimand to an army officer for getting into an argument.
  Tax accountant who avoids argument by praising the inspector's experience.
